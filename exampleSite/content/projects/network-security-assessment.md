# Network Security Assessment

## Project Overview

Performed a comprehensive network security assessment for a mid-size organization, evaluating network infrastructure, security controls, and configuration management practices.

## Scope

- **Network Infrastructure**: Routers, switches, firewalls, and network segmentation
- **Security Controls**: Access controls, monitoring systems, and incident response capabilities
- **Configuration Review**: Security policies, hardening standards, and compliance requirements

## Assessment Methodology

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance
- Network discovery and mapping
- Service enumeration and version identification
- Network topology analysis

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Manual configuration review
- Security control evaluation

### Phase 3: Penetration Testing
- Network penetration testing
- Social engineering assessment
- Physical security evaluation

## Tools & Techniques

- **Nmap**: Network discovery and service enumeration
- **Nessus**: Vulnerability scanning and assessment
- **Wireshark**: Network traffic analysis
- **Metasploit**: Exploitation framework
- **Custom Scripts**: Automated testing and reporting

## Key Findings

### Network Security Issues
- Weak network segmentation
- Outdated firmware on critical devices
- Insufficient monitoring and logging

### Configuration Vulnerabilities
- Default credentials on network devices
- Unnecessary services enabled
- Weak encryption protocols

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
- Implement network segmentation
- Update firmware and patch management
- Strengthen access controls

### Long-term Improvements
- Deploy network monitoring solutions
- Implement security awareness training
- Establish regular security assessments

## Impact

The assessment identified several critical vulnerabilities that could have led to unauthorized network access and data breaches. Implementation of recommended security controls significantly improved the organization's security posture.
