# Web Application Penetration Testing

## Project Overview

Conducted a comprehensive penetration test of a web application following OWASP testing methodology. The assessment identified critical vulnerabilities and provided actionable remediation recommendations.

## Methodology

- **Reconnaissance**: Information gathering and target enumeration
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Automated and manual testing
- **Exploitation**: Proof-of-concept exploits for identified vulnerabilities
- **Reporting**: Detailed findings with remediation steps

## Tools Used

- **Burp Suite Professional**: Web application testing and proxy
- **OWASP ZAP**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **Nmap**: Network reconnaissance and service enumeration
- **SQLMap**: SQL injection testing
- **Custom Python Scripts**: Automated testing and data analysis

## Key Findings

### Critical Vulnerabilities
- SQL Injection in user authentication module
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in user input fields
- Insecure direct object references

### High-Risk Issues
- Weak session management
- Insufficient input validation
- Information disclosure through error messages

## Impact & Remediation

The identified vulnerabilities could have led to data breaches, unauthorized access, and system compromise. Comprehensive remediation recommendations were provided, including:

- Implementation of parameterized queries
- Input validation and output encoding
- Secure session management
- Security headers implementation

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced the importance of secure coding practices and the need for regular security assessments. It also highlighted the effectiveness of combining automated tools with manual testing techniques for comprehensive vulnerability identification.
